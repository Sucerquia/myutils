      This code extracts the sections in a file starting and finishing with specific
      patterns without including the lines containing those patterns. Check the next
      options:
      
        -f  <file> file that shows 
        -s  <pattern> pattern that defines the beginning of the block. This line
            is not included in the block.
        -e  <pattern> pattern that defines the end of the block. This line is not
            included in the block.
        -i  use this flag if the start and the end are indexes
        -o  <output='output'> 'terminal' or the name of the output without
            extension. In the later case, the output will be stored in a file
            called <output>.dat if the flag -i is given or in files called
            <output>_<n>.dat, where n is the number of appearence of the block in
            the file.
      
        -v  verbose of what's the code doing.
        -h  prints this message.
